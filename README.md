# compare_deepspeed_optimized_model_and_standard_model

Not only you can optimize your model with this code,

you also can see how fast it become.

It shows how much time you can save with deepspeed optimized model and how much f1 score you can gain too.

Optimize model you want to optimize and see how fast and accurate it becomes!
